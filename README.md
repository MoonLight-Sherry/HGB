# Heterogeneous Graph Benchmark

Revisiting, benchmarking, and refining Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks.

**This repo is actively under-development.** Therefore, there are some extra experiments in this repo beyond our paper, such as graph-based text classification. Moreover, we are adapting HGB with [cogdl](https://github.com/THUDM/cogdl). For more information, see our website (under construction).

## Roadmap

We organize our repo by task. Each folder contains a task and the structure is similar, i.e. reproducing experiments for each method in each sub-folder and benchmark experiments in benchmark sub-folder.

```
task/
    method1/
    method2/
    ...
    method_n/
    benchmark/
        scripts/
            data_loader.py
        methods/
            method1/
            method2/
            ...
            method_n/
```

### Node classification
