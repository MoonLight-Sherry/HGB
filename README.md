# Heterogeneous Graph Benchmark

Revisiting, benchmarking, and refining Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks.

## Roadmap

We organize our repo by task. Each folder contains a task and the structure is similar, i.e. reproducing experiments for each method in each sub-folder and benchmark experiments in benchmark sub-folder.

```
task/
    method1/
    method2/
    ...
    method_n/
    benchmark/
        scripts/
            data_loader.py
        methods/
            method1/
            method2/
            ...
            method_n/
```
